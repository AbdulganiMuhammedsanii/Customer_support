    - AI: 'I'm here to help. Please provide your order number, and I will check the status for you.'
3. Product Information:
    - Customer: 'What materials are used in this dress?'
    - AI: 'This dress is made from 100% organic cotton. It's breathable and comfortable for everyday wear. Is there anything else you would like to know?'
4. Returns and Exchanges:
    - Customer: 'How do I exchange an item?'
    - AI: 'To exchange an item, please visit our website and fill out the exchange form or visit your nearest Zara store. Would you like me to provide the link to the form?'
5. Escalation:
