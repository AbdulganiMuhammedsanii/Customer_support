A student shall be guilty of violating the Code and subject to proceedings under it if they: knowingly represent the work of others as their own; use or obtain unauthorized assistance in any academic work; give fraudulent assistance to another student; fabricate data in support of laboratory or field work; forge a signature to certify completion or approval of a course assignment; or in any other manner violate the principle of absolute integrity.",
      "specific_remarks": "Unless otherwise specified by the individual professor, the work you do in Computer Science courses is expected to be the result of your individual effort. Discussion of general strategy or algorithms is permissible, but you may not collaborate in the detailed development or actual writing of an assignment. The penalty for any violation of this Code in Computer Science courses may be failure in the course. Computer accounts are provided for course work only. They are not private accounts; they belong to the Department of Computer Science and the use of these accounts will be monitored in various ways."
